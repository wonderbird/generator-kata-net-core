## Identify Code Duplication (Windows only)

The `tools\dupfinder.bat` file calls the [JetBrains dupfinder](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/dupFinder.html) tool and creates an HTML report of duplicated code blocks in the solution directory.

In order to use the `tools\dupfinder.bat` you need to globally install the [JetBrains ReSharper Command Line Tools](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/ReSharper_Command_Line_Tools.html)

From the folder containing the `.sln` file run

```
tools\dupfinder.bat
```

The report will be created as `dupfinder-report.html` in the current directory.
